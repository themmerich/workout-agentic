/**
 * Encrypts the secrets workout stores on behalf of a tenant — today a tenant's own AI key, and
 * whatever else follows it. AES-256 in GCM mode, so a stored value is not only unreadable but
 * also tamper-evident: a modified ciphertext fails to decrypt rather than yielding garbage.
 *
 * <p>The key comes from configuration and never from the repository. Without it the application
 * refuses to start: a wrong or missing key would silently turn every stored secret into an
 * unreadable string, and whatever uses it would fail hours later with an error that points
 * nowhere near the cause.
 *
 * <p>Every ciphertext carries a version prefix. It says two things: that the value is encrypted
 * at all — which is what lets rows written before this existed be read as they are — and with
 * which generation of key material, so a future re-key can tell them apart.
