# Code Review

Review work before it cascades. Prefer an independent code reviewer subagent, but run the same
read-only review yourself when no subagent is available. Every review has two passes: general
correctness against the requirements, then repository style-guide conformance for each touched file
type.

**Core principle:** Review early, review often.

## When to Review

**Mandatory:**

- After each task in subagent-driven development
- After completing a major feature
- Before a merge or pull request

**Optional but valuable:**

- When stuck (fresh perspective)
- Before refactoring (baseline check)
- After fixing complex bug

## Review Scopes

Choose exactly one scope before gathering context:

| Scope             | Use when                                             | Inspect with                                                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current work      | Reviewing unstaged changes and untracked files       | `git status --short`, `git diff`, and explicit reads of untracked files   |
| Staged work       | Reviewing only what is ready to commit               | `git status --short`, `git diff --cached`, and `git diff --cached --stat` |
| Last commit       | Reviewing exactly the previous commit                | `git show --stat HEAD` and `git show HEAD`                                |
| Merge or PR range | Reviewing branch work against another branch or base | `git merge-base HEAD <target>` then `git diff <base>..HEAD`               |

For merge or PR reviews, include staged or unstaged work only when the user explicitly asks for it
or when it is clearly part of the work being reviewed.

_Done when_ the review scope, diff commands, and any included working-tree state are explicit.

## Process

### 1. Establish Scope

Inspect the repository state and compute the review target deliberately:

```bash
git status --short
```

Use `HEAD~1..HEAD` only for the Last commit scope. For merge or PR reviews, ask for the target
branch if it is not stated and cannot be inferred from the task. Do not move HEAD or mutate the
index while establishing scope.

_Done when_ scope, base, head, and working-tree inclusion are recorded in concrete Git terms.

### 2. Gather Review Context

Write a compact handoff for the reviewer:

- `{DESCRIPTION}` – Brief summary of what you built
- `{PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS}` – What it should do
- `{VERIFICATION}` – Commands run, results, and known failures or skipped checks
- `{REVIEW_SCOPE}` – Current work, Staged work, Last commit, or Merge or PR range
- `{DIFF_COMMANDS}` – Exact commands the reviewer should use

_Done when_ the reviewer can understand the intended behavior, changed range, and verification
state without reading this session's history.

### 3. Load Style Guides

The style guides live in the repo-root `style-guide/`. The Markdown and Git guides apply to the
whole repository; the code guides apply to the Angular frontend (`frontend/`). For code changes
outside `frontend/` (e.g. the Spring Boot `backend/`), skip the code guides and note that no
frontend style guide applies.

For touched files under `frontend/`, read `style-guide/style-guide.md` first, then read
only the specific style guides for the touched file types:

- TypeScript or Angular code: `style-guide/style-guide.ts.md`
- Angular templates: `style-guide/style-guide.html.md`
- SCSS: `style-guide/style-guide.scss.md`
- Accessibility-sensitive template or UI changes: `style-guide/style-guide.a11y.md`
- Tests: `style-guide/style-guide.spec.md`
- NPM dependency or package changes: `style-guide/style-guide.npm.md`

Repo-wide, regardless of package:

- Markdown documentation: `style-guide/style-guide.md.md`
- Git workflow, commits, or branch changes: `style-guide/style-guide.git.md`

_Done when_ every touched file type has a corresponding style-guide check, or the change has no
applicable guide and that is noted as not-applicable.

### 4. Dispatch or Run the Review

Dispatch a `general-purpose` subagent with the template at
[references/code-reviewer.md](references/code-reviewer.md).

If subagents are unavailable, run the same template yourself as a read-only review and say that no
independent subagent was available.

_Done when_ the review is returned, or the fallback review limitation is reported.

### 5. Verify and Act on Feedback

- Check every reviewer finding against the codebase before editing
- Fix valid Critical issues immediately
- Fix valid Important issues before proceeding
- Note Minor issues for later
- Push back on incorrect findings with file/line evidence or test output

_Done when_ each Critical and Important finding is fixed, explicitly deferred by the user, or
rejected with evidence.

## Example

```text
[Review staged work before committing]

You: Let me run the code-review skill before committing.

REVIEW_SCOPE: Staged work
DIFF_COMMANDS:
  git status --short
  git diff --cached --stat
  git diff --cached

[Dispatch code reviewer subagent or run the same review directly]
  DESCRIPTION: Added verifyIndex() and repairIndex() with 4 issue types
  PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS: Task 2 from docs/superpowers/plans/deployment-plan.md
  VERIFICATION: pnpm test -- verify-index passed; pnpm lint passed
  REVIEW_SCOPE: Staged work
  DIFF_COMMANDS: git diff --cached --stat; git diff --cached

[Subagent returns]:
  Strengths: Clean architecture, real tests
  Issues:
    Important: Missing progress indicators
    Minor: Magic number (100) for reporting interval
  Assessment: Ready to proceed

You: [Fix progress indicators]
[Continue to Task 3]
```

## Integration with Workflows

**Subagent-driven development:**

- Review after each task
- Catch issues before they compound
- Fix before moving to next task

**Executing Plans:**

- Review after each task or at natural checkpoints
- Get feedback, apply, continue

**Ad-Hoc Development:**

- Review before merge
- Review when stuck

## Red Flags

**Never:**

- Skip review because "it's simple"
- Ignore Critical issues
- Proceed with unfixed Important issues
- Argue with valid technical feedback

**If the reviewer is wrong:**

- Push back with technical reasoning
- Show code/tests that prove it works
- Request clarification
