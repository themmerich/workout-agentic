# Skills

Agent skills for this repository live under `.claude/skills/`. Each skill folder contains a
`SKILL.md` plus optional `references/`, `scripts/`, or `assets/` support files loaded just in time.
They fall into two groups: **third-party skills** copied or adapted from public sources, and
**custom skills** authored in this repository.

To keep this index honest, run the
[`update-skills-directory`](.claude/skills/update-skills-directory/SKILL.md) skill whenever a
skill is added, renamed, or removed – it verifies skill frontmatter, support-file structure, and
links from this index.

## Why skills keep your context clean

Reaching for a task-specific skill instead of loading everything from `AGENTS.md` is one of the
most important things you can do for output quality. `AGENTS.md` is always in context, so every
piece of general guidance it carries crowds the window with instructions irrelevant to the task at
hand. A skill is pulled in only when the task calls for it, keeping that guidance out of context
until it matters.

That keeps the working context lean and focused – and a lean, focused context is exactly what gets
good results out of an LLM. A bloated context dilutes attention, buries the relevant instructions,
and degrades the quality of the answer. So prefer a narrow skill for a specific job over piling
more general rules into `AGENTS.md`.

## Third-party skills

Copied or adapted from public sources; the origin column records where each skill came from.

| Skill                                                          | What it does                                                                                           | Origin                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Scanning skills for vulnerabilities

Skills are executable instructions, so a third-party skill is as risky as any dependency you pull
in. Vet every third-party skill with [NVIDIA SkillSpector](https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillSpector)
before adopting it here (see the [scanning guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/skills/scanning-agent-skills)).

### Overlap and precedence

The third-party [angular-developer](.claude/skills/angular-developer/SKILL.md) skill covers some
topics that dedicated custom skills own (forms, e2e tests, a11y, styling, migrations). On overlap,
the narrower custom skill (`ng-forms`, `create-e2e-tests`, `ng-accessibility`, `ng-styling`,
`ng-migrate`) wins; the project [`style-guide/`](style-guide/style-guide.md) overrides both.

## Custom skills
